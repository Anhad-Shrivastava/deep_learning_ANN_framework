# deep_learning_ANN_framework
Welcome to my first Deep learning Framework
As I am specializing in Deep Learning, I have taken upon myself the challenge of creating my own deep learning frameworks which will help me comprehend the most intricate details and intuitions behind the Algorithms and Mathematics used in every step of a Deep Learning Model. This model is a basic Deep Learning framework with the capability to work on basic Artificial Neural Netowrks.

Targets
1) Include all activations possible into the framework
2) Include provision for mini-batch gradient descent
3) Enable Features for all Optimizations including mainstream ones such as RMSprop, Adam etc.
4) Provide a feature for Regularization of various kinds such as L2,L1, dropout etc
5) Create capabilities to store model history and save models previously trained
